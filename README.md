Arxiv Ideate is an intelligent research discovery engine designed to help researchers navigate the overwhelming landscape of academic literature. By processing thousands of arXiv papers through high-dimensional semantic analysis, this platform identifies research gaps and synthesizes novel, future-proof hypotheses.

Whether you are a student, a researcher, or an innovator, Arxiv Ideate serves as your companion in the quest for original research directions.

## How It Works

Imagine trying to read every paper published in AI over the last few years. It is impossible. Arxiv Ideate does the heavy lifting for you by treating the entire corpus of research as a semantic map.

First, the system converts every paper abstract into a mathematical vector that captures its deep meaning. It then groups similar papers into clusters. These clusters represent established research neighborhoods.

The magic happens when the engine looks at the borders between these neighborhoods or combines themes from two different areas (like combining hardware optimization with emotional AI). This cross-pollination generates new ideas that would take a human researcher months to discover manually. In short, it maps what we know to help find what we don't.

## Core Features

Semantic Discovery: Maps the research landscape using sentence transformers and HDBSCAN clustering to find hidden patterns.

Automated Ideation: Synthesizes novel research directions by combining themes across different academic domains.

Foundational Search: Provides a semantic search interface to find high-impact papers that form the basis of specific research topics.

Modular Design: Built as a clean Python package, allowing for easy expansion and integration into other research pipelines.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. You will also need sufficient disk space for the initial dataset download and embedding cache.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd arxiv-ideate
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Initializing the Engine

The first time you run the project, it needs to build its internal map. This involves downloading the latest arXiv dataset, filtering for relevant papers, and generating semantic embeddings.

Execute the build script:
```bash
python scripts/build_cache.py
```
Note: This process may take 10 to 20 minutes depending on your hardware, as it processes thousands of papers. Once completed, the cache is saved locally for near-instant subsequent use.

## Usage

Launch the interactive interface with the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Navigating the Interface

Once the CLI starts, you can choose from three primary modes:

Option 1: Generate New Ideas (Ideate)
Type in a concept you are interested in (e.g., "federated learning on edge devices"). The engine will find relevant clusters and synthesize five unique research directions.

Option 2: Find Foundational Papers (Search)
Enter a specific topic to find the most relevant papers. This uses vector similarity, so it understands the context of your query better than standard keyword searches.

Option 3: Run Analysis (Clustering)
Use this to refresh the clustering logic if you have modified the underlying data or parameters.

## Project Architecture

The system is organized into a modular structure for clarity and extensibility:

arxiv_ideate/data.py: Handles dataset ingestion, cleaning, and domain-specific filtering.
arxiv_ideate/model.py: Manages core ML tasks, including embedding generation and cluster detection.
arxiv_ideate/ideator.py: Contains the synthesis logic for generating research hypotheses.
arxiv_ideate/finder.py: Implements the vector search utility for finding landmark papers.

data/: Directory for cached datasets and persistent vector embeddings.
scripts/: Contains utility scripts for building and maintaining the research cache.

## Contributing

This project was developed with a passion for open research. We welcome contributions that improve clustering accuracy, add new data sources, or enhance the idea synthesis algorithms. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

Build the future of research with Arxiv Ideate.
